Ken Arnold has a new job as the director of a museum in Copenhagen. He really
likes *being* in a new city and *meeting* interesting people. But it's hard
work and he doesn't like being so busy and tired! When I ask him, 
"would you like to go back to your old job?" He says, "No, I wouldn't - I love
this job, but I would like to have more hours in the day!"
