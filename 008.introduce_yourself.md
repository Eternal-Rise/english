Hello. My name is Bogdan and I'm from Kyiv, Ukraine. I'm work at SmartTek as a Front End Engineer about half year.
And I think that I can stay here some long time.
For now I haven't some passions, only work. I'm love my work, so it's not horrible. Just haven't motivation, passion
for something else. In past, when I have a lot of free time, I love reading, I played the guitar, I ran.
It was so cool to ran a half of marathon distance. It was just for one time, but it was amazing. Yeah. But not I'm too lazy
